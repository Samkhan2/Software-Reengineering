Decompilation of Files, Code Analysis &amp; Control Flow 

Hello there!
I have uploaded some of the files that are been decompiled from apk, .exe and mac applications.
I have used Ghidora for the decompilation and code analysis, I decompiled files to C/C++ language.
Firstly i am using TempleRun apk, there are several steps to decompile any file.
 1. First Run ghidora.
 2. Create a new project.
 3. Import Files(apk, exe)
 4. choose your import language and processor.
 5. It will do some processing by itself.
 6. After import the classes will show up in the TREE View Section.
 7. Double click on classes, it will show you the binary code, and will ask for Analyzing the code.
 8. After Analyzing the code simply export it. File> Export Program> Choose Language > Destination > Name.
 9. It will start decompiling the file and will export it to the choosen destination.
 10. You can see your source code of the file.

Also i have used winrar.exe file, and openrefine(mac application) to decompile.
